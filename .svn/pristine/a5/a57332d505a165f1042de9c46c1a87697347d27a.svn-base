 *                             Individual tree nodes
 *  A tree node is a node in a balanced binary tree.
 *  Each node is linked with its parent node, and with the root nodes of
 *  subtrees which contain objects with strings lexically less than (left) or
 *  greater than (right) the string associated with this node.  In order for the
 *  tree to be balanced, the node also maintains the depth of each of its
 *  subtrees, and the insertion/deletion operations maintain the balance by
 *  ensuring that the difference between the left and right depths is no more
 *  than 1.
 *  Operations on the tree generally involve standard recursive tree traversal.
