NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of OpenSLP

New in openslp-0.7.6: (2000-10-28)
----------------------------------
* OpenSLP ported to FreeBSD. Compaq Tru64 support is also complete.
* Full predicate support has been added to OpenSLP.  slpd will now correctly 
  answer service requests containing LDAP filters
* As part of the Windows port, the MSVC project files added.  This should
  make it much easier for OpenSLP to be build on Win32 platform.
* Most of slpd and libslp code was tested against a malloc debugger.  Several
  bugs and memory leaks were fixed.


New in openslp-0.7.5: (2000-09-08)
----------------------------------
* OpenSLP ported to Win32.
* SLPFindSrvTypes() now works!
* libslp minor version updated.


New in openslp-0.7.4: (2000-09-01)
----------------------------------
* Finally added SA <--> DA communication resulting in an slpd that now acts as
  a much better SA and DA.  
* slpd (as a DA) responds to active DA discovery requests.
* slpd (as an SA) performs active DA discovery, supports passive DA discovery,
  supports static DA configuration, registers and de-registers services with 
  DAs.
* libslp now has the ability to register services with to the local slpd
  (SA), or a discovered DA.  This eliminates the need to have slpd running on
  all machines in certain cases. libslp can now request services from a DA 
  or via multicast or broadcast.
