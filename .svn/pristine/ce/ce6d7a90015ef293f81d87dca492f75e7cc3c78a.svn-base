Abstract

   This document describes the SLP URL format for the Service Location
   Protocol. The SLP URL is used to encode an SLP search query into a
   URL string, which facilitates the integration of SLP with systems
   that use URL as an interface, and provides a convenient way to
   express remote SLP discovery.

Internet Draft                  SLP URL                    June 14, 2002


1. Introduction

   The Service Location Protocol (SLP [1]) is a lightweight mechanism
   for service discovery in IP networks. There are three types of search
   queries in SLP: Service Request (SrvRqst), Service Type Request
   (SrvTypeRqst), and Attribute Request (AttrRqst). An SLP search query
   is sent from a User Agent (UA) to a Directory Agent (DA) via unicast
   or to all Service Agents (SAs) via multicast.

   This document describes the SLP URL format, which is used to encode
   an SLP search query into a URL [2] string. The SLP URL facilitates
   the integration of SLP with systems that use URL as an interface. For
   example, a client may want to enter an SLP search query as an SLP URL
   at a WWW browser where a regular URL is expected. Furthermore, the
   SLP URL provides a convenient way to express remote SLP discovery [3]
   since a remote domain name can be specified directly via the SLP URL.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted according to RFC 2119 [4].

2. The SLP URL Definition

   The SLP URL is defined using ABNF [9] as follows:

     slp-url        = "slp://" [domain-name] "/" query
     domain-name    = hostname from Section 3.2.2 of RFC 2396 [2]
     query          = query-id "?" [scope] "?" filter ["?" ext-list]
     query-id       = "SrvRqst" / "SrvTypeRqst" / "AttrRqst"
     scope          = scope-list from Section 6.4.1 of RFC 2608 [1]
     filter         = srv-filter / srvtype-filter / attr-filter
     srv-filter     = "type=" service-type [";pred=" predicate]
                      [";spi=" spi-str]
     service-type   = service type defined in Section 4 of RFC 2608
     predicate      = predicate from Section 8.1 of RFC 2608
     spi-str        = SPI defined in Section 9.2 of RFC 2608
     srvtype-filter = "na=" nalenstr
     nalenstr       = "0" / "-1" / nastr
     nastr          = naming-auth from Section 2.1 of RFC 2609 [5]
     attr-filter    = "url=" url [";tag=" tag-list] [";spi=" spi-str]
     url            = URL defined in Section 4 of RFC 2608
     tag-list       = tag-list from Section 10.3 of RFC 2608
     ext-list       = extension / extension ";" ext-list
     extension      = attr-ext / select-ext / sort-ext
     attr-ext       = "ext=attr"
     select-ext     = "ext=select;" max-num
     max-num        = intval from Section 5 of RFC 2608
     sort-ext       = "ext=sort;" sort-key-list

     sort-key-list  = sort-key-list from Section 3 of [8]

   When the domain-name is omitted, the search query is resolved
   locally. The UA sends the query to the DAs it knows in the
   corresponding scopes, or multicasts the query if no DAs are known in
   the specified scopes.

   When the domain-name is present, the search query is resolved in the
   specified remote domain. Normally the UA first obtains a list of DAs
   and/or SAs at the specified remote domain via DNS SRV [6], then it
   sends the query to the chosen DAs or SAs.

   One of the three query-ids ("SrvRqst", "SrvTypeRqst" or "AttrRqst")
   MUST be given in an SLP URL.

   If the scope is omitted, the UA SHOULD use the default scope
   "DEFAULT".

   One of the three SLP filters (srv-filter, srvtype-filter, or attr-
   filter) MUST be given in an SLP URL, and MUST match the query-id in
   the SLP URL.

   A srv-filter MUST specify a service type, and MAY also specify a
   predicate and/or an SLP Security Parameters Index (SPI) string.

   A srvtype-filter MUST specify a naming authority, where "0" means
   IANA, "-1" means all naming authorities.

   An attr-filter MUST specify a URL whose attributes are to be
   retrieved, and MAY also specify a tag list and/or an SPI string.

   An SLP URL MAY have an extension list (ext-list). Currently, the
   formats for Attribute List [7], Selection [8] and Sort [8] extensions
   have been defined.

   A Selection Extension specifies the maximum number (max-num) of URL
   entries as a decimal integer whose range is 1 to 65535.

   A Sort Extension specifies the sort-key-list using the format defined
   in Section 3 of [8].

3. Examples

   o slp:///SrvRqst??type=printer

     find all printers at the local domain

   o slp://example.com/SrvRqst??type=printer
