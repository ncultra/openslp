If you are compiling openslp from CVS you will find that some files needed
to build openslp are missing from the CVS repository. These files are 
automatically generated by the GNU tools automake and autoconf. Please run the 
script ./autogen.sh from the top of the CVS tree to generate these files. You
need to do this only once.
