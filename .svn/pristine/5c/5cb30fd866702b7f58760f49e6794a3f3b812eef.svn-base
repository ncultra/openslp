03/05/01 matt@caldera.com
Fixed a very very hard to find problem where regtypes were being cleared by
local re-registration (.reg registration re-registered when we discovered

02/08/01 matt@caldera.com
UA requests may only be serviced by DAs if a known DA is found that supports
ALL the scopes in the request scope list.

02/08/01 matt@caldera.com
Added code to make sure that DAAdvert bootstamps are never the same in 
messages generated by slpd

Changes to use SLPXidGenerate() from common/slp_xid.c to generate Message 
XIDs instead of rand()

12/19/00 matt@caldera.com
Changes as suggested by Olaf Kirch's security audit

12/15/00 matt@caldera.com

12/14/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
slpd.log and slpd.pid file locations now change depending on the prefix. 

12/13/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Introduced predicate version field in srvrqst structure. Passed predicate 
version (v1 or v2) all the way down to SLPDPredicateTest(). 
SLPDPredicateTest() does not handle v1 predicates yet, so it still returns
success without looking at the predicate.

12/12/00 matt@caldera.com
Added code to refresh SLP_LIFETIME_MAXIMUM services

12/12/00 matt@caldera.com
Fixed bug where non-responsive DAs were used repeatedly

Fixed DA / SA lookup code in libslp.  Fixes infinite loop under certain
error producing situations 

12/08/00 matt@caldera.com
Fixed errorcode stomping in slpd and libslp.  Now appropriate message should
get passed to the API caller

12/08/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Second set of 64-bit cleanups - removed converted all size_t datatypes to
int to be consistent with the rest of the code.

12/07/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Changed AC_OPENSLP_* macros to OPENSLP_* macros as per recommentation in
the Goat book (autoconf/automake/libtool book by the authors).

12/06/00 matt@caldera.com
Fixed bug where certain services were being omitted from a SrvTypeRply

12/06/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
64-bit cleanups - change timestamps and signatures to int instead of long.

12/06/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Changed v1ProcessDASrvRqst to use SLPDAEntry. Added passive DAAdverts
for SLPv1.
	
*** TAG OpenSLP 0.8.0 ****

11/30/00 matt@caldera.com
Changed license comments in all source files

11/28/00 matt@caldera.com
More efficient rewrite of code that selects a DA to satisfy API requests

11/28/00 matt@caldera.com
Implemented SLPFindScopes() in libslp

11/21/00 matt@caldera.com
Send dead DAAdvert as part of graceful shutdown

11/21/00 matt@caldera.com
DAs now echo local registrations to other DAs (slpd as a DA also acts like
an SA for local API callers)

11/20/00 matt@caldera.com
Added code to ensure we respond correctly (with AUTHENICATION_UNKNONW) when\
a request with a SPI is received

11/16/00 matt@caldera.com
Changed SLPD behaviour to be less destructive on SIGHUP.  SIGHUP no longer
dumps the entire registration database on SIGHUP.  SIGHUP only causes slpd
to re-read configuration and static registration as well as perform DA
discovery.

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.8 ***

11/2/00 matt@caldera.com
Added graceful shutdown code

11/2/00 matt@caldera.com
Removed ALL memory leaks from slpd and libslp (predicate code not done yet)

10/31/00 matt@caldera.com
libslp now asks slpd for known DAs before multicasting requests

10/31/00 matt@caldera.com
Slpd running as a DA now performs passive discovery

10/25/00 matt@caldera.com
Slpd running as an SA now re-registers all services with a new DA

10/17/00 matt@caldera.com
Added code to database to utilized revised libslpattr call.  Now taglists in
AttrRqsts are honored

10/17/00 matt@caldera.com
Added some significant fixes to make slpd work properly on multi-homed 
machines

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.7 ***

10/11/00 matt@caldera.com
Rewrote the README file and removed README.CVS.

10/11/00 matt@caldera.com
Made changes to configure.in so that new predicate code is not build by
default.  Also added old predicate code back in (behind #ifdefs) so that at
least the original functionality will be there for 0.7.7

10/06/00 matt@caldera.com
Added code to make libslp reuse TCP connections

10/06/00 matt@caldera.com
Fixed timing bug in slpd where in some cases a non-blocking recvfrom() was 
called before any data could possibly be in the stream.  This would cause
libslp to return unexplained -19 on SLPReg() and friends.

10/05/00 matt@caldera.com
Active DA discovery is now working correctly.  There is still need for 
code to be added so the DAAdvert statless bootstamp is honored correctly.
The SA should re-register all services with a DA if it is new or bootstamp
is stale

09/29/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Implemented SLPv1 support when running as a DA. This can be turned off by the
configure option --disable-slpv1. New files common/slp_v1message.h,
common/slp_v1message.c, slpd/slpd_v1process.c. SLPv1 packets can have multiple
character encodings, OpenSLP supports only ASCII and Unicode encodings.

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.6 ***

09/27/00 hughes@lab43.org
Changed slpd's internal representation of attributes to use libslpattr. This
gives  much finer control over attributes, paving the way for filter support
and attribute freshening. 

09/27/00 hughes@lab43.org
Integrated filter support into slpd. This can be found in 
slpd/slpd_predicate.*. Regression test added in test.  

09/19/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Changed slpd to bind the multicast socket to INADDR_ANY instead of the SLP 
multicast address. Binding to the multicast address causes BSD derived OSs
to put the multicast address instead of the host address on outgoing packets.
With this fix (and a couple of others), OpenSLP works on FreeBSD and 
Compaq Tru64. 

09/18/00 mdes@ocegr.fr
Added Rick Braddy's MSVC Project files so that now OpenSLP should compile 
easily on Windows machines in Visual Studio

09/05/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Finally was able to reproduce (thanks to Jon) and fix bugs 109358 and 109359

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.5 ***

09/05/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Merged Mattieu Desmons's Win32 port of OpenSLP

09/05/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.4 ***

8/30/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Finally added functionality to slpd so that as an SA  it will find and 
register with all known DAs.  

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.2 ****

08/16/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Made significant changes that streamline main execution loop of slpd. 

08/11/00 matt@calderassystems.com
Fixed several sneeky memory leaks and memory access bugs that delt with
langtags in libslp. Fixes bug #111058 - Pointer issues in slpd.

08/04/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
OpenSLP ported to Solaris (2.6/7) and Linux Alpha. Also functional on
Compaq Tru64. Building is now possible on non-gcc compilers.

08/04/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Documentation updates - codeset converted to iso-8859-1 and spell checked.

08/04/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Modified slpd command line parameter parsing to print version and help 
information

08/02/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Build changes to take advantage of automake/libtool integration. Building 
with builddir != srcdir works. DESTDIR is supported for make install to
ease packaging. Test suites are integrated and run using 'make check'.  

07/17/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Finalized the DA discovery routines in libslp

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.1 ***

07/11/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Fixed 109269 - SLPFindSrvs callback no longer gives a LAST_CALL

07/11/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com

Automake/Autoconf ones.

07/06/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Added in a NEWS file

06/28/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Added multicast DA discover support to the library

06/28/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Centralized the request reply engine for the library to libslp_network.c

06/28/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Added support for net.slp.multicastTimeouts, net.slp.unicastTimeout, and
net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts

06/13/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Added in SLPUnescape function, and changed the documentation to reflect 
it.

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.6.7 ***

05/15/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Fixed a major bug that caused the library to freeze when slp.conf was changed

05/15/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Brushed up traceMsg a little more.  Needs a little more work to be really
useful.  The framework is there though.	 
 
05/12/00 matt@calderasystems.com
Add framework to support traceMsg functionality.  Still needs a little 
brushing up, but the main part is done.
