README OpenSLP releas 0.7.0
---------------------------

OpenSLP release 0.7.0 contains significant code changes from the original is
based on the original Caldera Systems source code snapshot from 
April.  Additional features (such as DA support in the library and
configuration enhancements have been added, but most of the changes to the 
code were made to tighty things up in order to (hopefully) make OpenSLP
easier to port and maintain. 

The OpenSLP library is nearly complete (about 90%) which means that 
for a few exceptions, it will change very little in the next major
releases (0.8.x, 0.9.x and 1.0.x).  The OpenSLP daemon, on the other
hand is only about 60% complete.  Look for major feature enhancement to 
slpd in the future.

Sufficent testing resources have not been available to properly test OpenSLP.
Therefore, we can not currently give an accurate expectation with regard to
stability and functionality.  Please send email to notify us of any bugs
