As a validation test for any changes made to SLPParseSrvURL() code, you
should run the following:

./slp_parsesrvurl < test.in | diff expected.out - 

Basically what this does is take all the service urls from the test.ing
file, parses them and prints the output to stdout.  stdout is piped to diff
which compares it to an expected output.  

If there are any differences then the test failed.
