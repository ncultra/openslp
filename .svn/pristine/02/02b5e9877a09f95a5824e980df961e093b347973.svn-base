NEWS - list of user-visible changes between releases of OpenSLP

New in openslp-0.7.5: (2000-??-??)
----------------------------------
* SLPFindSrvTypes() now works!
* libslp minor version updated.

New in openslp-0.7.4: (2000-09-01)
----------------------------------
* Finally added SA <--> DA communication resulting in an slpd that now acts as
  a much better SA and DA.  
* slpd (as a DA) responds to active DA discovery requests.
* slpd (as an SA) performs active DA discovery, supports passive DA discovery,
  supports static DA configuration, registers and de-registers services with 
  DAs.
* libslp now has the ability to register services with to the local slpd
  (SA), or a discovered DA.  This eliminates the need to have slpd running on
  all machines in certain cases. libslp can now request services from a DA 
  or via multicast or broadcast.
