Basic Installation
==================

To install OpenSLP use the following command from the top-level OpenSLP
directory:

	make install
	
Since installation scripts copy files to protected areas of the filesystem
(/usr/bin, /usr/doc, and /usr/lib), you will need to su to root before 
running make install
	


Makefiles
==========

Yeah... the OpenSLP make files are pretty bad.  Please be patient, better make
files will be comming soon.
