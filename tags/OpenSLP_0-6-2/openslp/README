README OpenSLP releas 0.6.1
---------------------------

OpenSLP release 0.6.1 is based on the original Caldera Systems source code 
snapshot from April.  Some SLPv2 features were not implemented because they 
were not considered overly useful.  Please see the Project Roadmap 
<http://www.openslp.org> for an idea of what still needs to be finished.  

Sufficent testing resources have not been available to properly test OpenSLP.
Therefore, we can not currently give an accurate expectation with regard to
stability and functionality.  Please send email to notify us of any bugs 
<mpeterson@calderasystems.com>.
