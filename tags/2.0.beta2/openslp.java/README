* Configuring Java clients with Security
**************************************************
1. net.slp.securityEnabled MUST be set to true
2. The following properties are NOT defined in RFC 2614 but are
   used by the Java SLP API to configure security.

net.slp.spi - should be set to a list of available SPIs on this machine
  Ex: "myspi,spi2"
  Default: ""
net.slp.privateKey.<spi> - should be set to the location of the DER
  encoded unencrypted PKCS8 format private key for this spi.
net.slp.publicKey.<spi> - should be set to the location of the DER
  encoded DSA public key for this spi.

3. Note that the public and private keys defined here are NOT the same
   format as required by slpd.  OpenSSL may be used to perform the
   conversion.
