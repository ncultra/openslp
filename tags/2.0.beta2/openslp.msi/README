OpenSLP Windows Installer (msi) README file.

Introduction
-------------
This directory contains the required source files and scripts to create a 
Windows Installer .msi file for OpenSLP. 

The WIX toolset version 3.0 is required to build a .msi file from the source 
files in this directory. WIX is a Microsoft-sponsored open source project 
hosted by sourceforge.net (http://wix.sf.net) that provides a simple, but 
powerful layer on top of the Windows Installer database interface. WIX stands 
for Windows Installer XML. Install WIX 3.0, add the WIX root directory to your 
path, and create an environment variable called WIX_PATH, also set to the root 
of the WIX directory structure.

The following scripts are available for your convenience:

makesrc.cmd - creates the installation source directory structure. This script
        takes three optional parameters (plus various help option syntax). By 
        default the script will execute like this:

        c:> makesrc --src ..\openslp --tgt .

        Where the --src parameter indicates the source of the copy operation, 
	and the --tgt parameter indicates the target or destination of the copy 
	operation. An optional --debug parameter allows you to build an 
	installer based on debug product files, rather than release product 
	files. The --help command will give you a help screen.

build.cmd - runs candle.exe on the openslp.wxs file, and then light.exe on the
        resulting openslp.wixobj file, linking the appropriate WIX libraries. 
	The output of build.cmd is an openslp_<version>_<machine_tag>.msi file,
        where the default values of <version> and <machine_tag> are 2.0.0 and
        x86, respectively. These options are specified on the build.cmd command
        line, as follows:

	c:> build --ver <version> --arch <machine-arch>

	An --help option is available for a parameter help screen.

Have fun!
