<h2>
Installing OpenSLP on Linux</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Installation</h3>
Installing the latest distribution of OpenSLP is easy.&nbsp; Pay attention
to the following steps and you should not have any problems.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>RPM Installation

<ul>
<li>
Download the latest RPM file from <a href="http://www.openslp.org">www.openslp.org</a>.
Select the appropriate distribution.</li>

<li>
Become root (root is usually the only user that can install packages).</li>

<li>
Install the package. This is typically done with:</li>

<ul><tt>rpm -Uvh openslp-x.x.x.rpm</tt></ul>

<li>
Make any configuration changes to the <tt>/etc/slp.conf</tt> file that
you think you need. (see <a href="SlpConf.html">Configuration</a> for details)</li>

<li>
Set up static registrations in the <tt>/etc/slp.reg</tt> file if you need
them. (see <a href="SlpReg.html">Static Registrations</a> for details)</li>

<li>
Start the OpenSLP daemon.</li>

<ul><tt>/usr/sbin/slpd</tt></ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Tarball Installation

<ul>
<li>
Download the latest tarball(.tar.gz) file from <a href="http://www.openslp.org">www.openslp.org</a></li>

<li>
Unzip and untar the file into an appropriate directory.</li>

<ul><tt>tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz</tt></ul>

<li>
Become root (root is usually the only user that can install daemons and
libraries).</li>

<ul>su root</ul>

<li>
Enter the extracted openslp directory build and install the OpenSLP binaries:</li>

<ul><tt>./configure</tt></ul>

<ul><tt>make</tt></ul>

<ul><tt>make install</tt></ul>

<li>
Make any configuration changes to the <tt>/etc/slp.conf</tt> file that you think
you need. (see <a href="SlpConf.html">Configuration</a> for details).</li>

<li>
Set up static registrations in the <tt>/etc/slp.reg</tt> file if you need them.
(see <a href="SlpReg.html">Static Registrations</a> for details).</li>

<li>
Start the OpenSLP daemon.</li>

<ul><tt>/usr/sbin/slpd</tt></ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<tt>Making slpd start on boot</tt></h3>
<tt>You may want to make a few changes to your Linux initialization scripts
so that slpd will start when your machine is booted.&nbsp; Since it is
not always necessary to have slpd running, <b>you should probably read about
when (and why) the OpenSLP daemon has to run in the <a href="index.html">Advanced
Topics</a> section before deciding to changing your init scripts</b>.</tt>
<h3>
<tt>Removing the distribution directory from your system</tt></h3>
<tt>Unless you will be doing OpenSLP development work, you will probably
want to remove the distribution directory from your system after OpenSLP
is installed.&nbsp; The distribution directory is the one that was created
by the tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz command.&nbsp; During installation,
all of the important files were copied out of this directory to the appropriate
places on you machines file system so it can be deleted with out breaking your
installation of OpenSLP.</tt>
