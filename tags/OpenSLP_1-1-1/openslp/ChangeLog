*** TAG OpenSLP-1.1.1 ***

02/22/02 matt@caldera.com
Added fix from Arun Barboza to make V1 DAAdverts use the same encoding as
the request

02/22/02 matt@caldera.com
Added patch from Arun Barboza to handle "==" V1 predicates.  This allows
OpenSLP to be useful in servicing request in Novell NetWare environments.

02/13/02 matt@caldera.com
Added PID monitoring.  Now when the process that called SLPReg() (with
SLP_REG_FLAG_WATCH_PID) dies the registration will automatically be deregistered.

01/25/2002 matt@caldera.com
Added relevant fixes from the stable branch:
   - Applied patch from Garth Bushell that fixes a problem where not enough
     memory was being allocated to hold an escaped string in SLPEscape().
   - Fixed some problems with multicast route handling code in the slpd
     startup script
   - Moved Win2000 specific defines inside #ifdef WIN32
   - Changed slpd "daemonize" code to chdir() to "/"

01/24/2002 matt@caldera.com
Changed the code in slpd_property.c to use the functions in slp_net.c and
slp_iface.c to get interface and hostname information

01/24/2002 matt@caldera.com
Moved URL parsing code to common code (slp_parse.c) and added a few network
utility functions (slp_net.c).  Modified slpd code so that DAs are contacted
via the IP address in the DAAdvert not the source address of the datagram.

*** Tag merged OpenSLP 1.0.6 ***

Finished the initial addition of all the new multicast code with significant
