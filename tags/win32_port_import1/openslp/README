README OpenSLP release 0.7.4
----------------------------
For several reasons, a public release of 0.7.3 will not be made available.
Instead, all changes have been rolled into 0.7.4.  Please be aware that 
in order to include the DA communication enhancements (detailed in the NEWS 
file) it was necessary to modify a good portion of the networking code.
This new code is not as mature as the 0.7.2 code.  Also, a fair amount of
work was done to simplify internal data structures to make way for future
enhancements.  It is expected that some users may just want to stick with
0.7.2 release unless the new DA features are important.  Be aware also that
there are a few DA communication issues that are not fully resolved (like
re-registration of existing services with a newly discovered DA)


README OpenSLP release 0.7.3
----------------------------

Autoconf/Automake generated files are removed from CVS. If you are building
OpenSLP from CVS, please run the script ./autogen.sh from the top of the CVS
tree to re-generate these files.


README OpenSLP release 0.7.2
----------------------------

OpenSLP 0.7.2 is again just slightly more stable than 0.7.1. For developers,
the build system has been revamped build system to take full advantage
automake and libtool integration. You can now build in a directory different
from the source directory. The test suite has also been integrated into
automake; you now need to run make check (instead of make test) to run the
tests. 


README OpenSLP release 0.7.1
----------------------------

As far as enhancements go OpenSLP release 0.7.1 just slightly more stable
release of 0.7.0. Several bug fixes (that kept 0.7.0 from working in some
cases) have been added.  For developers, OpenSLP 0.7.1 introduces a new make
file system that uses automake/autoconf...  one step closer to our goal of
making OpenSLP easier to port and maintain.


README OpenSLP release 0.7.0
----------------------------

OpenSLP release 0.7.0 contains significant code changes from the original is
based on the original Caldera Systems source code snapshot from 
April.  Additional features (such as DA support in the library and
configuration enhancements have been added, but most of the changes to the 
code were made to tighty things up in order to (hopefully) make OpenSLP
easier to port and maintain. 

The OpenSLP library is nearly complete (about 90%) which means that 
for a few exceptions, it will change very little in the next major
releases (0.8.x, 0.9.x and 1.0.x).  The OpenSLP daemon, on the other
hand is only about 60% complete.  Look for major feature enhancement to 
slpd in the future.

Sufficient testing resources have not been available to properly test OpenSLP.
Therefore, we can not currently give an accurate expectation with regard to
stability and functionality.  Please send email to notify us of any bugs
