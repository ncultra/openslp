<h2>
The slp.conf File</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The slp.conf file contains configuration information that affects the
operation of the OpenSLP daemon (slpd) and any application that uses the
OpenSLP library.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The master slp.conf file is located
at <tt>/etc/slp.conf</tt>.&nbsp; There is <a href="CommandLine.html">command
line option</a> that forces slpd to read a different configuration file,
but the SLP library is hard coded to read from <tt>/etc/slp.conf</tt> and
can only be changed by re-compiline the library.
<p>The OpenSLP slp.conf file diverges <i>slightly</i> from the <a href="../../rfc/rfc2614.txt">RFC
2614</a> specification for the slp configuration file, so you should probably
<a href="#Divergance from RFC 2614">Divergance
from RFC 2614</a> even if you are familiar with the RFC spec.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
File Syntax</h3>
The slp.conf file syntax is very simple.&nbsp; OpenSLP follows the syntax
specified in <a href="../../rfc/rfc2614.txt">RFC 2614</a> which is simply
a list of key/value pares separate by &lt;cr>&lt;lf>.&nbsp; Comment lines
begin with a '#' or a ';'.&nbsp; A good example file is copied to <tt>/etc/slp.conf</tt>
with the OpenSLP distribution. Take a look at it or <a href="../../rfc/rfc2614.txt">read
the RFC if you need more details</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Settings</h3>
The following is a list of settings that are supported by OpenSLP:
<p><b><tt>net.slp.useScopes</tt></b>
<blockquote>This option is a comma delimited list of strings indicating
the only scopes a UA or SA is allowed when making requests or registering
or the scopes a DA must support. The default value is "DEFAULT".</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.DAAddresses</b>
<blockquote>Allows administrator to force UA and SA agents to use specific
DAs.&nbsp; If this setting is not used dynamic DA discovery will be used
to determine which DAs to use.&nbsp; Default is to use dynamic DA discovery.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.isBroadcastOnly</b>
<blockquote>Force broadcasts to be used instead of multicast. This setting
is seldom necessary since OpenSLP will automatically use broadcast if multicast
is unavailable. Default is false.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.passiveDADetection</b>
<blockquote>A boolean indicating whether passive DA detection should be
use. Default is true.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.activeDADetection</b>
<blockquote>A boolean indicating whether active DA dection should be used.
Note that if both passive and active DA detection are disabled, DAs will
not be used unless they are statically configured using the net.slp.DAAddresses
property. Default is true.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.multicastTTL</b>
<blockquote>A positive integer that is less than or equal to 255.&nbsp;
The default is&nbsp; 255.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.multicastMaximumWait</b>
<blockquote>An integer giving the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds)
to perform multicast requests.&nbsp; Default is 15000 ms or 15 secs.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.unicastMaximumWait</b>
<blockquote>An integer giving the maximum amount of time (in milliseconds)
to perform unicast requests. Default is 15000 ms or 15 secs.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.randomWaitBound</b>
<blockquote>An integer giving the maximum value for all random wait parameters.
Default is 1000 or 1 sec.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.MTU</b>
<blockquote>A integer giving the network packet MTU in bytes.&nbsp; Default
is 1400 bytes.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.interfaces</b>
<blockquote>A list of IP address of network interfaces on which the DA/SA
should listen for slp requests.&nbsp; By default, OpenSLP will use all
interfaces.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.securityEnabled (currently ignored)</b>
<blockquote>Indicates whether all agents should use authentication blocks.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.locale (currently ignored)</b>
<blockquote>A RFC 1766 Language Tag [6] for the language locale.&nbsp;
Setting this property causes the property value to become the default locale
for SLP messages.&nbsp; Default is "en".&nbsp; This property is also used
for SA and DA configuration.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.maxResults (currently ignored)</b>
<blockquote>A 32 bit integer giving the maximum number of results to accumulate
and return for a synchronous request before the timeout, or the maximum
number of results to return through a callback if the request results are
reported asynchronously.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.isDA (currently ignored)</b>
<blockquote>A boolean indicating if the SLP server is to act as a DA. If
false, not run as a DA. Default is false.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.DAHeartBeat (currently ignored)</b>
<blockquote>A 32 bit integer giving the number of seconds for the DA heartbeat.&nbsp;
Default is 3 hours (10800 seconds).&nbsp; Ignored if isDA is false.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.DAAttributes (currently ignored)</b>
<blockquote>A comma-separated list of parenthesized attribute/value list
pairs that the DA must advertise in DAAdverts.&nbsp; The property must
be in the SLP attribute list wire format, including escapes for reserved
characters. [7]</blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Divergance from RFC 2614"></a>Divergence from RFC 2614</h3>
OpenSLP does not support all of the settings that are specified by RFC
2614.&nbsp; The reasons for not supporting some of the settings range from
the implementors' opinions that they are either not useful or very difficult
to implement with regard to their usefullness.&nbsp; The following is a
list of options that OpenSLP has no plans to support.
<p><b>Tracing and logging options</b>
<blockquote>The tracing and logging options specified in the RFC are really
only useful as debugging tools.&nbsp; Most of the logging options from
the RFC would require possibly lengthy configuration file checks in very
critical code paths. Therefore, the decision for now has been to make loging
a compile time option in OpenSLP.&nbsp; The default log level should display
enough information for the average SLP configuration. See the make file
for details on log levels.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.serializedRegURL</b>
<blockquote>slpd accepts the [-r] command line parameter that specifies
the serialized registration file to use.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.DAActiveDiscoveryInterval</b>
<blockquote>OpenSLP does not honor this parameter unless it is set to zero.&nbsp;
When set to zero active discovery is turned off.&nbsp; See net.slp.activeDADetection</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.multicastTimeouts</b>
<blockquote>OpenSLP does not honor this parameter.&nbsp; Multicast timeouts
are generated internally based on the .net.slp.multicastMaximumWait parameter.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts</b>
<blockquote>OpenSLP does not honor this parameter.&nbsp; Multicast timeouts
are generated internally based on the .net.slp.multicastMaximumWait parameter.</blockquote>
<b>net.slp.datagramTimeouts</b>
<blockquote>OpenSLP does not honor this parameter.&nbsp; Unicast timeouts
are generated internal based on the net.slp.unicastMaximumWait parameter.</blockquote>
