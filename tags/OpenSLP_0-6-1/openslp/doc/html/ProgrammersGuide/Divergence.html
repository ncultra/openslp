Divergence from RFC 2614</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
SLP Service URLs are required</h3>
SLP&nbsp;Service URL syntx is required for all functions that accept url
strings.&nbsp; The following is a list of affected functions:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>SLPReg()</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>SLPDeReg()</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>SLPDelAttrs()</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>SLPFindAttrs()</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>SLPParseSrvURL()</tt></li>

<li>
<tt>SLPSrvURLCallback()</tt></li>
</ul>
The decision to require SLP&nbsp;Service URL syntax was made based on in
part the following scenario:
<blockquote>Suppose that two calls were made to SLPReg() with a <tt>srvurl</tt>s
and <tt>srvtype</tt>s of "192.168.100.2","http" and "192.168.100.2","ftp".&nbsp;
Now the developer wants to deregister one service with out deregistering
the other.&nbsp; How can it be done?&nbsp; The SLPDeReg() call does have
a service type parameter so it would be impossible for the underlying implementation
to distiguish between the two registrations.</blockquote>
Since the service-type is encapsulated by the SLP&nbsp;Service URL syntax,
this and several other problems are solved that would otherwise cause ambiguities
between distinct registrations.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
The SLPSetProperty() is ignored</h3>
The SLPSetProperty() and SLPGetProperty() calls are impossible implement
in a way that would be both scaleable and thread safe.&nbsp; The SLPGetProperty()
call could never be made thread safe unless return value was a pointer
to a buffer dynamically allocated the library and freed by the caller.
The SLPSetProperty() call would still access with the data store in such
a way that mutexes would be required to ensure that SLPSetProperty() and
SLPGetProperty() were never used the same buffers at the same time.&nbsp;
Even if a thread safe data store were devised, the SLPGetProperty() call
would be used so frequently during internal operations of the library that
performance might be adversly affected due to mutex bottlenecking or the
amount of processing required to resolve the attribute name to a value.

<h3>
Some features are not implemented</h3>
OpenSLP is a work in progress.&nbsp; Though useable, OpenSLP is lacking
some of the features that are specified by the SLP RFCs.&nbsp; Make sure
you know what features are not working, we tried to make note the features
that effect the API in the "Status" sections of the OpenSLP&nbsp;Programmers
Guide API&nbsp;documentation.
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://www.openslp.org/HowCanIHelp.html">How
Can I Help</a> section of the www.openslp.org web page to see a good list
of the features are planned for completion.&nbsp; If a feature is missing
from the list that you would like to see, please contact the <a href="mpeterson@calderasystems.com">OpenSLP
Maintainer</a>.
