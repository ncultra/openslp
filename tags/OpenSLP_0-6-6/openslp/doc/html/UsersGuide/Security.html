Security</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Protecting the daemon against attacks</h3>
The following measures have been taken to protect the OpenSLP daemon from
attacks:
<ul>
<li>
The OpenSLP daemon (slpd) must run as root initally in order to bind to
the well known SLP port.&nbsp; However, if the source is compiled with
the <tt>PARANOID</tt> defined, slpd will relinquish root priveledges and
suid() to the daemon user (if it exists).</li>

<li>
If slpd is build with <tt>PARANOID</tt> is defined, extra SLP message checking
is enforced.&nbsp; This slows down the operation of slpd slightly but ensures
that malformed or intentionally malicious SLP messages will not cause segmentation
faults in the daemon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Protecting the integrity of service registrations</h3>
Although not implemented in OpenSLP-0.6.0, OpenSLP will support the full
SLPv2 authentication specification which ensures that registrations can
not be modified in transit and that they are sent to and received from
a valid agents.&nbsp; See RFC 2608
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
User Level Access Control</h3>
Plans have been made to provide a mechanism that will enforce user level
access control that will allow the administrator to specify the users or
groups that can register services with SLP.
<br>&nbsp;
