<h2>
Installing OpenSLP on Linux</h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Simple Installation</h3>
Installing the latest distribution of OpenSLP is easy.&nbsp; Pay attention
to the following step and you should not have any problems:
<ul>
<li>
Download the latest tarball(.tar.gz) file from <a href="http://www.openslp.org">www.openslp.org</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Unzip and untar the file into an appropriate directory.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><tt>tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
Become root (root is usually the only user that can install daemons and
libraries).</li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>su root
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
Enter the extracted openslp directory build and install the OpenSLP binaries
using the top level make file.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><tt>make install</tt></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Make any configuration changes to the <tt>/etc/slp.conf</tt> file that
you think you need. (see <a href="SlpConf.html">Configuration</a> for details)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Set up static registrations in the <tt>/etc/slp.reg</tt> file if you need
them. (see <a href="SlpReg.html">Static Registrations</a> for details)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Start the OpenSLP daemon.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><tt>/usr/sbin/slpd</tt></ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Making slpd start on boot</h3>
You may want to make a few changes to your Linux initialization scripts
so that slpd will start when your machine is booted.&nbsp; Since it is
not always necessary have slpd running, <b>you should probably read about
when (and why) the OpenSLP daemon has to run in the <a href="index.html">Advanced
Topics</a> section before deciding to changing your init scripts</b>.
<h3>
Removing the distribution directory from your system</h3>
Unless you will be doing OpenSLP development work, you will probably want
to remove the distribution directory from your system after OpenSLP is
installed.&nbsp; The distribution directory is the one that was created
by the <tt>tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz</tt> command.&nbsp; During installation,
all of the important files were copied out of this directory to the appropriate
places on you machines file system so it can be deleted with out ruining
OpenSLP.
