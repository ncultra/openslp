1 - Introduction
-----------------
The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of
Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial 
application.

The latest version of OpenSLP is 0.7.8  Changes for this version and the
previous version consist of the following:

    - slpd now does a graceful shutdown on SIGTERM to deregister serviced
      with DAs    
    - Considerable time spend using commercial debugging tools to remove
      ALL memory leaks from slpd (without predicates) and libslp. 
    - IPC (via loopback) is now used by libslp to obtain DA information
      from slpd before multicasting
    - slpd running as a DA now sends passive DAAdverts
    - slpd running as an SA now performs active DA discovery
    - slpd running as an SA now re-registers all services with new DAs
    - Significant fixes were made to make slpd work properly on multi-homed
      machines
 

2 - Roadmap
------------
OpenSLP is getting very close to being release in alpha and beta form.  It
is currently useable for most applications, but still lacks a few important
features:
    
    - slpd does not honor the predicate in SrvRqst messages.  (this feature
      is nearly finished but is still not ready for general use)
    - libslp does not collate results for syncronous calls
    - libslp does not support asyncronous calls


3 - Building OpenSLP
---------------------
Building OpenSLP requires the proper installation of automake, autoconf and
libtool.  To build OpenSLP please use the following steps:

    - Unzip and untar the openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz tarball.
   
      $ tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz 
	  
    - Run the autogen.sh script to generate configure script. Do not be
      alarmed if the autogen script prints a few errors.  Try the resulting
      configure (next step) script anyway.
      
      $ cd openslp-x.x.x
      $ ./autogen.sh
	  
    - Run the configure script to create openslp make files.  Please note that
      the configure script accepts several --enable-xxxx and --disable-xxxx
      options that should be interesting to you.  Run ./configure --help and 
      read the details of each of these switches. If the configure
      script fails... now you have a problem.
     
      $ ./configure --help
      $ ./configure
	  
    - Run the top level make file (you need to use GNU make)
    
      $ make
	  
    - If the make is successful, look for the following binaries:
      
      slpd/slpd
      libslp/.libs/libslp.so
      test/.libs/*


4 - Installing OpenSLP       
-----------------------
To install OpenSLP make the install target in the top level make file
    
    $ make install
    
Installation of OpenSLP creates the following files:
    
    /usr/sbin/slpd 
    /usr/lib/libslp.so.x.x (and several appropriate links)
    /usr/lib/libslp.a 
    /etc/slp.conf          (old slp.conf is renamed)
    /etc/slp.reg           (old slp.reg is renamed)
    

5 - OpenSLP Users Guide 
------------------------
Rather than be repetitive in this document, the reader is refered to a fairly
complete OpenSLP users guide that is available in the doc/html directory
of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web at:
    
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide
    
The OpenSLp users guide gives instruction on how network and system
administrators should configure and use OpenSLP once it is installed


6 - OpenSLP Programmers Guide
------------------------------
Again, to avoid repetition, the reader is refered to a the Programmers Guide
available in the doc/html directory of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web 
at:
   
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/ProgrammersGuide
    
    
7 - FAQ
--------
A really compresensive FAQ is not yet available for OpenSLP so please send
you questions to the OpenSLP mailing lists:

    openslp-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
    openslp-users@lists.sourceforge.net
    
Q: Where is the configure script?
A: Did you read section 3 of this document?  You need to run autogen.sh to
   generate the configure script.
   
Q: How do I build OpenSLP on Windows?  
A: The MSVC project files used by the developers who ported OpenSLP to win32
   available in the source directories.  If you do not use MSVC and you are a 
   Windows developer, then you will be used to trying to get MSVC makes to
   work with your tools
   
Q: Will OpenSLP work on my operating system
A: Yes, the OpenSLP code has proven to be very portable.  It currently works
   many operating systems including: Linux, BSD, Solaris, Tru64, HPUX, and
   Windows
