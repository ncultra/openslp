1 - Introduction
-----------------
The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of
Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial 
application.

The latest version of OpenSLP is 0.9.1  Release notes for this version follow:

OpenSLP 0.9.1 is a bug fix release.  It does not offer any new features, but
since some the fixed bugs were fairly serious it highly recommended that
0.9.0 users upgrade. 

The following is a shortened list changes for 0.9.1: 
- Fixes all known bugs (SourceForge bug tracker 
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=1730&atid=101730 for details)
- Minor build changes for BSD
- Fixed up broken SLPv1 support.Changed includes of the form 
  "../common/header.h" to "header.h" because of potential breakage for
  non source directory builds.
- Added a EPM slp.list.in file and updated configure.in. EPM is an Easy 
  Package Manager (http://www.easysw.com/epm) that allows easy creation of 
  different packaging formats.)
       
2 - Roadmap
------------
OpenSLP is getting very close to being released in beta form.  It is 
currently useable for most applications, but still lacks a few important
features:
    
    - libslp does not collate results for syncronous calls
    - libslp does not support asyncronous calls


3 - Building OpenSLP
---------------------
Building OpenSLP requires the proper installation of automake, autoconf and
libtool.  To build OpenSLP please use the following steps:

    - Unzip and untar the openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz tarball.
   
      $ tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz 
	  
    - Run the autogen.sh script to generate configure script. Do not be
      alarmed if the autogen script prints a few errors.  Try the resulting
      configure (next step) script anyway.  If the ./configure script already
      exists, skip running ./autogen.sh
      
      $ cd openslp-x.x.x
      $ ./autogen.sh
	  
    - Run the configure script to create openslp make files.  Please note that
      the configure script accepts several --enable-xxxx and --disable-xxxx
      options that should be interesting to you.  Run ./configure --help and 
      read the details of each of these switches. If the configure
      script fails... now you have a problem.
     
      $ ./configure --help
      $ ./configure
	  
    - Run the top level make file (you need to use GNU make)
    
      $ make
	  
    - If the make is successful, look for the following binaries:
      
      slpd/slpd
      libslp/.libs/libslp.so
      test/.libs/*


4 - Installing OpenSLP       
-----------------------
To install OpenSLP make the install target in the top level make file
    
    $ make install
    
Installation of OpenSLP creates the following files:
    
    /usr/sbin/slpd 
    /usr/lib/libslp.so.x.x (and several appropriate links)
    /usr/lib/libslp.a 
    /etc/slp.conf          (old slp.conf is renamed)
    /etc/slp.reg           (old slp.reg is renamed)
    

5 - OpenSLP Users Guide 
------------------------
Rather than be repetitive in this document, the reader is refered to a fairly
complete OpenSLP users guide that is available in the doc/html directory
of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web at:
    
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide
    
The OpenSLp users guide gives instruction on how network and system
administrators should configure and use OpenSLP once it is installed


6 - OpenSLP Programmers Guide
------------------------------
Again, to avoid repetition, the reader is refered to a the Programmers Guide
available in the doc/html directory of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web 
at:
   
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/ProgrammersGuide
    
    
7 - FAQ
--------
The frequently asked questions have been moved to a faq.html file located in 
the doc directory of the OpenSLP tarball.
