=============================================================================

15/03/2010 richard.morrell@uk.thalesgroup.com
Update to introduce indexing of service types and attributes to improve search
performance when the daemon has a large number (hundreds) of services.
Indexing is optional, and controlled by the configuration file.
Predicate searching has been refactored to pre-parse the predicate and the
attributes, so even non-indexed searches should see a speed-up.

24/09/2008 richard.morrell@uk.thalesgroup.com
Add an option to the slp.conf file whereby all DAs can be configured to
regularly broadcast their presence (DA Advert) at a settable rate (dependent
on the daemon's timer interval), and all DAs & SAs so configured will monitor
the broadcasts, and remove a DA from the list of known DAs if three
consecutive broadcasts are missed.

24/09/2008 richard.morrell@uk.thalesgroup.com
Implement "multi-unicast" for IPv4 - find a spanning list of DAs that,
together, support all the scopes, and search all of them by unicast in
parallel.

*** TAG OpenSLP-1.3.0 ***
03/02/2004 beastham@emware.com
IPv6 support has been added to OpenSLP.  It is generally transparent to the
API user, but it would be a good idea to look at the conf file additions to
acquaint yourself with the new settings available.

Added fix from Arun Barboza to make V1 DAAdverts use the same encoding as
the request

02/22/02 matt@caldera.com
Added patch from Arun Barboza to handle "==" V1 predicates.  This allows
OpenSLP to be useful in servicing request in Novell NetWare environments.

02/13/02 matt@caldera.com
Added PID monitoring.  Now when the process that called SLPReg() (with
SLP_REG_FLAG_WATCH_PID) dies the registration will automatically be deregistered.

01/25/2002 matt@caldera.com
Added relevant fixes from the stable branch:
   - Applied patch from Garth Bushell that fixes a problem where not enough
     memory was being allocated to hold an escaped string in SLPEscape().
   - Fixed some problems with multicast route handling code in the slpd
     startup script
   - Moved Win2000 specific defines inside #ifdef WIN32
   - Changed slpd "daemonize" code to chdir() to "/"

01/24/2002 matt@caldera.com
Changed the code in slpd_property.c to use the functions in slp_net.c and
slp_iface.c to get interface and hostname information

01/24/2002 matt@caldera.com
Moved URL parsing code to common code (slp_parse.c) and added a few network
utility functions (slp_net.c).  Modified slpd code so that DAs are contacted
via the IP address in the DAAdvert not the source address of the datagram.
