<h2>
SLP Syntaxes</h2>
<hr width="100%">
<h3><a name="Service Type"></a>SLP Service Type Syntax</h3>
The official definition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Service
Type</span> strings can be found in <a href="../../rfc/rfc2609.txt">RFC
2609</a>, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Service Templates and
Service Schemes</span>".&nbsp; If you will be
working with "well-known" (IANA) service types, you should read it.
If you are developing applications for proprietary services then you
will probably be satisfied with the following explanation:
<blockquote><b>Service-Type =
"service:"&lt;abstract-type.naming-authority&gt;":"&lt;concrete-type&gt;</b></blockquote>
The abstract-type is simple (hopefully short) descriptive string that
describes
the over-arching type of service, and defines a set of common
attributes (and perhaps default values) for all service types that fit
into this abstract classification. The naming-authority is the name
(hopefully
unique) name of the organization that named the service. The
naming-authority
is optional, but if it is omitted then IANA is assumed to be the naming
authority, and IANA requires service-types to be registered (see RFC
2609).
The concrete-type is also optional. Think of a concrete-type as a
kind of sub-type of the abstract-type. For programmer, this should be
easy: An abtract-type is like a C++ abstract base class, and may not be
instantiated. A concrete-type is derived therefrom, and can be
instantiated. For example, "printer" is
an abstract-type (owned by IANA) and "printer:lpr" is a concrete type
(owned
by IANA).
<h4>Service Type Examples</h4>
"weather.nasa:wtp"&nbsp; - A (fictitious) weather service type owned by
NASA that uses WTP protocol
<br>
"weather.nasa:swtp" - A (fictitious) weather service type owned by NASA
that uses SWTP protocol.
<br>
"chat.superchat" - A chat service type owned by SuperChat
<br>
"printer.samba" - A samba printer service type
<br>
"ftp" - An IANA ftp service type
<br>
"telnet" - An IANA telnet service type
<h4>Comparing Service Types</h4>
Since service types are important in determining the URL's that are
return
by the <tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs</a></tt> function,
you should
understand how OpenSLP compares services. Suppose that three services
were registered with <tt><a href="SLPReg.html">SLPReg</a></tt> using
a <tt>srvtype</tt> of "printer:lpr", "printer" and
"printer.acme".&nbsp;
If a client program calls <tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs</a></tt>
with a <tt>srvtype</tt> of "service:printer" the URL's for both
"printer:lpr"
and "printer" are returned ("printer.acme" is not). However, if <tt><a
 href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs</a></tt>
is called with <tt>srvtype </tt>of "printer:lpr" or "printer.acme"
then
the urls for "printer:lpr" or "printer.acme" would be returned. In
other words, if a concrete type is used, only services with same
abstract-
and concrete-type are returned. If only the abstract-type is used
then all services of that abstract-type (and naming authority) are
returned.
<h4>A word about naming authorities</h4>
It is our opinion that developers MUST use a naming authority if an
IANA
service template has not been defined that fits the type of service
that
is being supplied by their application. If developers use a predefined
IANA service template they must use it correctly. However, IANA also
makes it possible to test experimental service types in an public
environment. In this case, types should begin with the "x-" prefix. No
IANA registered types will ever start with "x-"<br>
<h3>
<a name="Service Url"></a>SLP Service Url Syntax</h3>
URL strings are passed as parameters to the <tt><a href="SLPReg.html">SLPReg</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPDereg.html">SLPDeReg</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPDelAttrs.html">SLPDelAttrs</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="SLPParseSrvURL.html">SLPParseSrvURL</a></tt>
functions and returned in the form of results to the <tt><a
 href="SLPSrvURLCallback.html">SLPSrvURLCallback</a></tt>
callback function. SLP defines a special type of URL called a Service
URL that MUST be used when calling OpenSLP API functions. If you
decide to use Service URLs extensively, you should probably read <a
 href="../../rfc/rfc2609.txt">RFC
2609</a>, but if you just want to know what they look like, the
following
explanation should be good enough:
<blockquote><b><tt>SLP Service URL =
"service:"&lt;service-type&gt;"://"&lt;addrspec&gt;</tt></b></blockquote>
The <tt>service-type</tt> is a service type as explained above. The <tt>addrspec</tt>
portion can be just about anything you want that fits URL syntax and
can be translated as a network location. The "<tt>service:</tt>"
and "<tt>://</tt>" strings are required URL syntax.
<h4>Service URL Examples</h4>
"service:weather.nasa:wtp://weather.nasa.com:12000"
<br>
"service:weather.nasa:swtp://weather.nasa.com:12001"
<br>
"service:chat.superchat://chat.superchat.com;auth=ldap"
<h4>Do I have to use the SLP Service URL syntax for my urls?</h4>
Yes. With OpenSLP you are required to use Service URL's. API functions
will return SLP_PARSE_ERROR if you do not. The reason that OpenSLP
requires Service URL syntax is because the SLP API designers do not
allow the
service-type to be passed in as a parameter to the <a
 href="SLPDeReg.html">SLPDeReg</a> call. Without the service-type,
SLPDeReg does not allow the caller to distinguish
between services of varying types that were registered with the same
standard
URL.
In other words, service-types fully qualify the entry in the SLP
database.&nbsp;<br>
<h3>
<a name="LDAPv3 Filter"></a>LDAPv3 Search Filter Syntax</h3>
An LDAPv3 Search Filter string is passed as a parameter to the <a
 href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs</a>
function. If you want the definitive explanation of LDAPv3 search
filters, you can read <a href="../../rfc/rfc2254.txt">RFC 2254</a>, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">String
Representation of LDAP Search Filters</span>".
