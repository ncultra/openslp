NOTICE
------
slptool is no longer being maintained in the openslp.contrib module. To find
the latest version of slptool, look in the openslp CVS module where slptool
is hopefully living a happy live with other core peices of OpenSLP.

You can still build this older version of slptool (last shipped with OpenSLP
0.8.1) by typing:

$make slptool

... though I don't know why you would not be more interested in the latest
version that can be obtained from the latest OpenSLP.
