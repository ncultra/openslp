OpenSLP Test Suite
------------------

This test suite will exercise the OpenSLP API under several different test
conditions.  There are two parts to the test suite: 1) Static Tests and 2)
Dynamic Tests.  Static tests require a specific slp.reg file which is provided.
The static tests attempt to locate the services specified in the static
registration file. If all expected services are found, the test will pass.
Dynamic tests register services during the test, then attempt to locate
and de-register the services.

Installation and Setup
----------------------


1 - Build the test suite.
    To build the test suite, you must edit the SETUP.mk file. Change the SLPROOT 
    variable to indicate the absolute path to the OpenSLP source tree. 

    Type 'make' from the distribution root to build all of the binaries.

2 - Set up the test environment.
    
    Type 'make setup' to bBack up the existing /etc/slp.conf and /etc/slp.reg
    files then copy the test slp.conf and slp.reg files from slptest to the /etc 
    directory.  'make setup' also restarts slpd so that it will re-read the
    new registration and configuration files.
    
3 - Set up the run mode.

    DA Mode :
	Set net.slp.isDA=true  in /etc/slp.conf
	Start slpd.
	Type 'make test' from the distribution root.

    SA Mode :
	Set net.slp.isDA=false in /etc/slp.conf
	Start slpd.
	Type 'make test' from the distribution root.

    UA Mode :
	Start a slpd as a DA (see above) on another machine in the local network
	using the supplied slp.reg and slp.conf files.
	Type 'make test' from the distribution root.


Running the tests
-----------------
1 - Tests must be run as root.
    $ su

2 - Run the test by executing 
    $ make test
    

Analysing the test results
--------------------------
All of the tests should pass.  If they do not pass, there is either a bug
in the OpenSLP code or there is a problem with the slptest setup.
