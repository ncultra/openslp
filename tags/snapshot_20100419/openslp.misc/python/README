This is a simple python wrapper for OpenSLP using Greg Erwing's Pyrex
(http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/) extension tool.
You'll need at least Python 2.2 and Pyrex 0.5.

To try it out, run "make" in the current directory. If everything goes
well you should be able to run python and "import slp". See slptest.py
for usage examples.
